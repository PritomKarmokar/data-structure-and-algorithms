# Tree Note Section
## Tree 
 * A tree data structure is similar to trees in our real life. But, here root lies above of all
 * Here, 7, 9 and 17 nodes are connected directly with node 2, so they are child of node 2 and node 2 is the parent node of node 2, 7 and 17
 * In the below tree, 5, 10, 19, 6, 3, 4 and 1 these nodes have no child. That's why they are known as leaf node

## Binary Tree
 * In these type of tree a node can only contain maximum two child nodes
 * Since, Binary tree only can contain 2 child nodes, left sided child is known as left child or left node and right sided child is known as right child or right node

 * Height of binary Tree : It is defined as the maximum depth of any leaf node from the root node.

## Tree Traversing
 * There are mainly 03 algoriths for tree traversing :
  01. Pre-order
  02. Post-order
  03. In-order

### Pre-order traversal
 * In this way, we'll first visit the root node. Then traverse the left subtree using pre-order traversal approach and after that traverse the right subtree using pre-order traversal way.
