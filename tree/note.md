# Tree Note Section
## Tree 
 * A tree data structure is similar to trees in our real life. But, here root lies above of all
 * Here, 7, 9 and 17 nodes are connected directly with node 2, so they are child of node 2 and node 2 is the parent node of node 2, 7 and 17
 * In the below tree, 5, 10, 19, 6, 3, 4 and 1 these nodes have no child. That's why they are known as leaf node
